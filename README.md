## Team Profile Generator

## Welcome to the Team Profile Generator

The Team Profile Generator provides managers to be able to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic information. In this application, the user is prompted to select the type of employee, from the options of a manager, engineer or intern. The option of entering the team members name, ID, email and more specific questions like office number and school are asked as well. After this information is provided, a HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team! Not only this, but when the email address in the HTML is clicked, the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. Also, when the Github username is clicked, the GitHub profile then opens in a new tab! This application is an easy and efficient way to generate a Team Profile in an organized manner!
